            <h3> A Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a high-level diagram that represents a system or process as a
                single process box with its external entities and the data flows between them. It is also known as a
                context diagram.

                The Level 0 DFD is used to provide an overall view of the system or process being modeled. It shows the
                input and output data flows and the processes involved in transforming the data. The diagram is useful
                for identifying the system's external entities and their interactions with the system..</h3>

            <h3>A Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a more detailed diagram that expands on the processes and data
                flows shown in the Level 0 DFD. It breaks down the processes in the Level 0 diagram into subprocesses,
                each with its inputs and outputs.

                In a Level 1 DFD, each process in the Level 0 diagram is decomposed into a set of subprocesses, which
                are represented as separate process boxes. Each subprocess has its inputs, outputs, and data flows,
                which are shown as arrows between the process boxes.</h3>

                more detailed subprocesses, each with its inputs and outputs.

                In a Level 2 DFD, each subprocess in the Level 1 diagram is decomposed into a set of even more detailed
